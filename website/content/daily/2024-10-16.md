The idea of having memory management strategies
[that are not directly built into the language](/daily/2024-10-15) is not new.
[`malloc`] is just a function after all. [Rust] has the `Box` type, and
`Rc`/`Arc`. [Zig] adds another twist and requires an explicit allocator to
reserve memory on the heap.

As I've been working on this series of daily thoughts, I've realized what I want
for Caterpillar is basically [region-based memory-management]. A region would be
represented as a value in the language. Different types of regions could provide
different memory management strategies. And they'd use the linear type system to
make that sound, and as error-proof as they need to.

This also fits with the host concept. The core language would only know about
the stack. Access to the heap is provided by the host. I assume there would be
standardized interfaces, that region types written in Caterpillar could build
on. But also host-specific region types. A host running on a desktop or server
OS could provide different regions than one running on a microcontroller.
