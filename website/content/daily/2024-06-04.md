I've been having some trouble with presenting Caterpillar _concisely_. (Because
obviously, I have no trouble at all talking about it at length, day after day.)
The main difficulty for me, is to find a balance between communicating what the
project is about, without promising planned features that might never arrive.

I've updated the [README file in the Caterpillar repository][README] yesterday.
It starts with the vision, clearly presents it as such, but otherwise makes no
promises about things that don't already exist. Further down, I document the
design decisions that are already implemented in the language.

I'm somewhat happy with how that ended up. It's a bit sparse on details, but I
prefer that to fantasizing about things that will take me the next 20 years to
implement. Over time, the design section will grow, as more things are
implemented in the language.

I'd love to hear your feedback on that. [Please let me know][email] what you
think!
