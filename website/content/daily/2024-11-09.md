Implementing [a static type system](/daily/2024-11-08) for Caterpillar is not a
preposterous thing to do right now. The language is still untyped, which was
always going to be just a placeholder. And interactivity, the language's central
premise, currently has a
[big hole](https://github.com/hannobraun/caterpillar/issues/58), due to the lack
of static typing.

So yeah, working on deploying games to websites would still be more important,
but I figured, let's just see how hard this can be. And since my plan is to
center Caterpillar's type system around [type inference](/daily/2024-07-29), I
didn't want to design a type declaration syntax as a stopgap. How hard can a
_fully inferred_ static type system really be? Down the rabbit hole I went.

And as it turns out, _most of it_ isn't that hard. I had a compiler pass working
quite quickly, that can infer the types of most expressions. But there's one
_very_ tricky part, and that's type inference of recursive function calls.
