All kinds of behavior can be covered by effects. Where a given language lands
with that, is going to depend on its design goals. In Caterpillar, pretty much
everything, except pure computation is an effect, making it trivial to run the
language in a sandbox and port it to different platforms. (Thought it also
introduces overhead, conceptually in potentially in terms of performance.)

Having a [unified system](/daily/2024-12-15) in the language to govern effects
is kinda nice, leading to more coherence, consistency, and expressive power. But
how does that help us with the [problem of abstraction](/daily/2024-12-12) that
ad-hoc effects necessarily present?

Well, so far we've been missing the essential part that turns an effect system
into an _algebraic_ effect system: Effects need to be part of the type system.
And the type system must provide facilities to abstract over them. If a function
can say, "and by the way, I also have all the effects of the function you pass
to me", that can be a solution to [the mess](/daily/2024-12-12).
