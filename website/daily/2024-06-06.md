A lot got finished yesterday! Starting with function-scoped bindings. Those
started out globally scoped, but that was only a stopgap. I ran into some
trouble with them, so I made them local. And as it turns out, that was the last
language feature I needed to finish the game:

<video controls>
    <source src="2024-06-06/snake.webm" />
</video>

Even though I'm going to keep building on the same code, I've
[archived the prototype][prototype]. The next phase of work is going to change
and remove a lot of code, and I want to preserve the current working state
as-is.

And speaking of the next phase, I wasn't _quite_ ready to start on that
yesterday, so instead I implemented function-scoped stacks. Not enough space
left to explain that here, but I think that will be the topic of a whole series
of daily thoughts pretty soon.

The next milestone I'll focus on, is porting the game to browsers. More on that
tomorrow!
