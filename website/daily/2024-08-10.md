So I was [talking about `if`](/daily/2024-08-08), how I had found shortcomings
with it, and that I came up with an alternative. Then I went into
[detour on tail call elimination](/daily/2024-08-09) to set the stage for
explaining all of that. That detour would have continued to other topics, and
gone on for multiple days.

_Would have_, because while working on the drafts for that, I found an error in
my thinking. Basically, the same technique I intend to use as part of my new
solution, could have been used to fix `if`. Which is like 95% of the reason that
I write these daily thoughts. They help me think.

Sure would have been nice to have had this insight before I spent about a week
implementing pattern matching in function definitions to replace `if`, but hey,
that's how it goes sometimes. And I like the new solution better anyway, for
various reasons, so no harm done (except to my schedule). Anyway, still a lot to
explain about all that, so I guess that's what I'll do over the next few days.
