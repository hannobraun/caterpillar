I've been talking about
[how I/O can be represented in functional languages](/daily/2024-07-06),
covering Haskell's monad-based approach, and the simpler approach based on
values and linear types that I want to go with for Caterpillar. I've also said
that I/O in Caterpillar is represented in the form of
[effects that are executed by the host](/daily/2024-07-02).

Right now, this is an implementation detail. What's unclear to me, is whether
those effects are going to be present in the type system, in the form of
algebraic effects. Those are pretty neat, and they can be used for a lot of
things; from I/O, to error handling, and much more. But in each of those areas,
they compete with simpler language features, like plain values.

I'm sure I'll have more to say about algebraic effects in the future. (I have
drafts for a whole series of daily thoughts about that.) For now, I just wanted
to quickly mention them, as they relate to the topic of I/O in functional
languages. If you want to learn more in the meantime, I recommend you check out
the documentation of [Koka], which provides a nice introduction.
