Caterpillar has postfix operators and a stack-based evaluation model,
[but it isn't a stack-based language](/daily/2024-06-21). It doesn't use a
single data stack to pass arguments and return values between functions.
Instead, it works much more like a conventional language, with named arguments
and local scopes.

In Caterpillar, every function defines a number of named arguments. The
following pseudo-code (Caterpillar still
[does not have a syntax][Caterpillar code]) shows what that could look like:

```capi
fn add ( a b ) { a b + }
```

The arguments are bound to the specified names, `a` and `b`, which can then be
used as operands. The result of the `+` could be used as an operand for another
operation, but in this case, since the function ends there, the unused operand
is returned to the caller.

In a stack-based language, you could write the same function in a more compact
way:

```capi
fn add { + }
```

Here, the same global stack is available to all functions, enabling this more
compact representation. This has desirable properties, but
[since I found it too error-prone](/daily/2024-06-20), it's out for now.
