Many years ago, I watched Bret Victor's [Inventing on Principle]. It was
extremely inspiring, but I never used that inspiration. I never created
something from it.

Years later, I saw [Stop Writing Dead Programs] by Jack Rusher, and it hit me
like a brick. It shamed me! All these years that I knew of a better approach,
and I wasn't doing anything about it. This couldn't continue. And so I started
working on Caterpillar, an interactive language.

Interactivity isn't all that Caterpillar is about. I have many more ideas, some
of which [I already wrote about][design.md]. But it's how it all started. The
first seed of this project.
